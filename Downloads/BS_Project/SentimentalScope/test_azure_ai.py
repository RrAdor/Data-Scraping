    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to natural intelligence displayed by animals and humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
    
    The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
    
    Modern machine learning techniques are highly effective at perceiving patterns and making predictions. Many AI applications involve machine learning algorithms that can learn from data. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.
